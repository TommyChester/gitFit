Goals, I want to create a simple excercise diet app, I am looking for soundness of app not functionality. 
1. Rubo and Cypress testing 
2. Deployable through jenkins or circleCI
3. Hosted on aws
4. React Frontend 
5. User authenticated - google login, with a superuser. 

Current Plan:
1. To start with I am going to be setting up very very very simple CRUD for a workout using rails new.
2. I am going to set up some simple methods to set up rubo testing.
3. I am going to set up Cypress testing
4. Set up Hosting on AWS
5. Set up CI/CD
6. Add react front end (dont actually have to change appearance)
7. Set up different user authentication, specifically google login.
